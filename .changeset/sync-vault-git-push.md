### Removed
- `scripts/backup_vault.py`: Removed obsolete backup script in favor of direct external backup tools.
- `scripts/create_folders.py`: Removed obsolete initial folder scaffolding script.
- `scripts/check_folders.py`: Removed obsolete dry-run folder checker script.
- `scripts/add_gitkeeps.py`: Removed manual gitkeep script in favor of agentic gitkeep rules.
